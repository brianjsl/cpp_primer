Static and dynamic type can differ if the variable in question is a reference or pointer
variable. Some examples include:

a) Copy constructors and Copy-assign constructors for a Base Class (both take const references)
b) Pointers to a Base class (can take both the Base and Derived class types)
c) Other reference baseed function parameters
