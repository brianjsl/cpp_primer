We defined a default constructor for Disc_quote so that all the derived types could have
a synthesized constructor that could run the default constructor of the Base class namely
Disc_quote. If the default constructor for Disc_quote was defined as deleted, then Bulk_quote
would also have a deleted constructor, so we could not define a Bulk_quote with default arguments
(we would have to use one of the other defined constructors), so we could not define a Bulk_quote with default arguments
(we would have to use one of the other defined constructors).
