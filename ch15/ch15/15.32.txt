When an object of type Query is copied, we create another object that points to the same
Query_base class (with incremented reference count). If we move, we still point to the same
Query_base object but the reference count stays the same because the moved from object is 
nullified. If it is destroyed, depending on how many copies of the Query exist, the Query_base
object pointed to has reference count decreased until no more objects of such type exist and then
the object is freed.
