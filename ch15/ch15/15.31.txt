a) Query(s1) | Query(s2) & ~Query(s3) 
Query(s1) | (Query(s2) & (~Query(s3)))

Generates a Query object which points to a OrQuery with two operands a WordQuery and an AndQuery. 
The AndQuery points to a WordQuery and a NotQuery which points to a WordQuery.

b) Query(s1) | (Query(s2) & ~Query(s3))
Same as above as order of precedence makes it so that the two queries are grouped equivalently.

c) (Query(s1) & Query(s2)) | (Query(s3) & Query(s4))
Generates a Query that points to an OrQuery which points to two AndQuerys, each of which point to two 
WordQuerys respectively.
