If the rhs member returned an empty set then no lines would be inserted into the copy
of the lhs so we would just get the lhs lines. If the lhs member did so, we would start
with an empty set and just add the rhs lines. If both return empty set, we start with an
empty set and add nothing, so we still only have an empty set. All cases, as expected.
