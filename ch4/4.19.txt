a) True if ptr is not the nullptr and if the value ptr points to is nonzero (the 
increment is postfix so the original value it points to must be nonzero)

b) If both ival and ival +1 are nonzero returns true, otherwise false.

c) Invalid since no guarantee on order on which ival is operated. Can be corrected by 
comparing vec[ival] and ival[ival+1] and then doing ++ival.
