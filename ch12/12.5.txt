We want to automoatically be able to convert from an initializer_list to a 
StrBlob type object (as in the assignments in 12.1.cpp). The pros are it is
easy to intiailize StrBlob objects since we can simply assign to an initializer
list, the cons are that it can be not clear to differentiate between StrBlobs and
just regular vectors when intiailizing.
