All 4 are integral types but short have different minimum sizes in the order of short < int < long < long long (correspondingly 16, 16, 32, 64 minimum bits).

Unsigned types can only be nonnegative and the entire bit size is the span, while signed is split evenly between the positive and negative values. Float and double are both floating point types while double has increased precision (typically double in 2 words while float in 1, for an increase in around 4 significant digits).
