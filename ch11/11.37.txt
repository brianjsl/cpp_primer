An unordered_container can provide better (on average) performance for 
insert and find (amortized constant if large enough number of buckets)
if sufficiently good enough, and can also be used if there is no ovious ordering
relationship among the elements or if maintaining order is prohibitive.
On the other hand, ordered versions can be cheaper to maintain, and faster for
certain finds especially before tweaking the hash function.
