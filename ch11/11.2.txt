A list is useful when you don't need random indexing and you 
need constant time insertions in the middle of the arrays.
A vector is useful in the most general case as is a deque
if you need constant forward insertion as well (vectors are generally
faster than deques otherwise). A map is useful when you need to index
by a key (for example a dictionary), while a set is useful when you need
something either ordered or in the case of an unordered list, something
without duplicates, eg. a list of excluded words.
