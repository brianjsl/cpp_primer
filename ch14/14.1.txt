Overloaded operators can change the definition of what some operator means 
(for example the built in version of an operator) by expanding it's definition
to class types as well. 

They are the same as the built-in operators in that they use the same implicit
symbol and should provide (semantically) the same result when applied to objects
of class types as they would when applied to objects of built-in type.
