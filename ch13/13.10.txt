When a StrBlob is destroyed the data shared_ptr is decremented (since
the pointer is destroyed) and unless another StrBlob also uses the same
data as a shared_ptr, the underlying data is also destroyed since the 
reference count reaches 0. 

For a StrBlobPtr, the weak pointer member is destroyed (the underlying
data is unaffected), and nothing is done to the curr data member.
