If we hadn't defined a destructor, then the dynamically allocated
pointer to string (ps) would have memory that is never properly freed
which is an error (thus it is usually safer to use a shared pointer).
If we hadn't defined a copy constructor, HasPtr would act more like a 
pointer, with both the copy and the original pointing to the same
dynamically allocated string in the heap.
