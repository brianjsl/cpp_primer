The copy constructor must be able to create a new shared pointer that 
seperately copies the underlying vector so the newly created pointer can
point to it. 

The copy assignment operator must first free the underlying shared_ptr 
by resetting the shared_ptr and assigning it to a newly made shared_ptr
containing a vector that is copied from that of the original pointer.

The class does not need a destructor because shared_ptrs automatically
destroy the underlying objects when the reference count reaches zero so 
we can rely on the implicitly defined destructor.
