A copy-assignment operator is an operator that defines how assignment works 
for objects of some class type. It is used when assignment is performed (for an
operator that is of course, already initialized). The synthesized copy-assignment
operator works analogously to the copy constructor, instead for assignment using the
memberwise assignment operators for the members. It is synthesized when the class
does not define its own copy-assignment operator.
