When we run hp=hp2, because hp2 is an lvalue, the copy assignment operator
is invoked (since it is the closest match) and thus hp2 is copied into rhs 
parameter and then swap is run. Using std::move(hp2) returns an rvalue and
since our assignment operator is both the move and copy-assignment operator
the assignment operator is invoked. hp2 is however moved into rhs rather than
copied since the move constructor is a more exact fit, before swapping. So
overall, the copy assignment operator is used for the lvalue and the 
move assignment for the rvalue.
