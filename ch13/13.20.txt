The synthesized copy constructor for both TextQuery and QueryResult
copy the corresponding pointer members and map without changing the
underlying objects. If we assign the result is similar, and if we delete
the corresponding pointers are deleted with the underlying object being
destroyed when the reference count for the shared_ptrs lines/which_lines
reach 0.
