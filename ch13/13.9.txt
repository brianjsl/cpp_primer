A destructor member is a member function that is run when an object of the
class type is destroyed (either implicitly or explicitly). The synthesized
destructor is created implicitly if no other destructor is created and simply
destroys each member of the class using the destructors of the respective member
variables (or does nothing in the case of built-ins as they are simply overwritten
later on).
