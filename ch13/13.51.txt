The function is legal because we are about to destroy the unique_ptr that we
are creating, ie. the thing we are returning is an rvalue (rather than an lvalue)
so the unique pointer "knows" it can take ownership of the object that is about to
be released. Thus, it can use the move operator rather than the copy operator and 
only one pointer to the memory remains.
