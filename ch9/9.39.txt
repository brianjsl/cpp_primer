The vector of strings svec has a reserve of at least 1024 elements so 
it allocates space for at leat 1024 elemnts. Then, as you add elements to 
svec, up to 1024 of them can be added until reallocation is required. Once 
you are done adding elements, extra default initialized (blank) strings are 
added so the size of the new vector is 1.5 times the current size of the
vector.
