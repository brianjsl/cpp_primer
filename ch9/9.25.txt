This is an error because elem2 must be at least more than elem1 as otherwise there 
are no elements to remove. If both elem1 and elem2 are the off-the-end iterator the 
case is the same, otherwise if only elem2 is the off-the-end iterator and elem1 is less
than we erase all elements from elem1 onwards.
