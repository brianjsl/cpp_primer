The loop takes in a value of s from cin and check if s is equal to sought.
If s is equal to sought, then the assert sttement will hold true, otherwise
if the input is invalid, the statement holds false. So will throw an error
unless the value of s is sought, not a good idea. This will also not be executed
when run with the NDEBUG statement.
