A parameter is a local variable that is part of a function definition and must
be initialized through arguments in a call to said function. A local variable is 
any variable that is local to some scope (a parameter is a local variable for the
function). A local static variable is a variable that has lifetime as long as that 
of the program and thus can be used across function calls.

A set of parameters might be used for any function call (such as when an input value
is required), a local variable might be used for some intermediate calculations based
on the input values, and a static variable might be used for some calculation that must
be used across function calls.
