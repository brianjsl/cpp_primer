a) s is implicitly converted to a Sales_data object and then combined.
b) This is an error since s will be converted as a temp but we can't pass a temp by reference.
c) This is illegal because combine can not be const. If it were not const however, it would
be legal since we can implicitly convert a string to a reference to const
