An access specifier can appear as many times as needed. There are no restrictions 
on the number of access specifiers, although having too many may be convoluted. 
Members that should be publicly accessible (eg. functions that should be called
or member variables that can be changed publicly) should be public, while those
that should only be altered by the class (eg. should be encapsulated) should be
private.
