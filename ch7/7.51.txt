Because vector uses it as the number of arguments in the vector to default initialize
but if we define some vector as an int, it is ambiguous whether to specify the values
to that int, or the number of elements to some default value, etc. No such confusion
arises in a string on the other hand, since it is usually used to implicitly convert
a char[] to a string.
